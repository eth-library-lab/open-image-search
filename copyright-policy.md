The "open imageSearch" is a project run by the not-for-profit organisations ETH Library Lab and the Graphische Sammlung ETH ZÃ¼rich, both of which are a part of ETH Library.
The project is open-source and not-for-profit. All source code is freely accessible online and the hosted application (https://imagesearch.ellprototypes.ch) is free to use by the public (subject to fair usage policy).  

We endeavour to uphold all copyright restrictions for images displayed on our websites and cite all images where ever possible.  

The current phase of the project __only__ uses images that are marked as [Public Domain](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/pdm/) or [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/).

We do not display original images online in any of our software applications.  
Search results in application display low resolution (<50kB) previews of images (commonly known as thumbnails) and include links to the image source.  
Where ever possible, we include easily viewable information about credit line and artists and encourage people to view material on the source website.  

In the event that we have displayed an image that has copyright restrictions, please contact us at contact us at [https://www.librarylab.ethz.ch/contact/] and we will remove the image as soon as possible.
